# French Word Embeddings
French Word Embeddings from series subtitles.

The current repository includes three versions of word embeddings :

  1. [Word2Vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) by Google
  2. [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) by Stanford NLP
  3. [FastText](https://fasttext.cc/) by Facebook's AI Research - FAIR
 
All these models are trained using [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) software's built-in functionalities.

Currently, the vocabulary is about 25k words based on subtitles after the preproccessing phase. 

The vocabulary is clean and contains simple and meaningful words.
